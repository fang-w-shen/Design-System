    <h2 id="tabs-Usage">Usage</h2>
    <p>A tab view presents multiple mutually exclusive panes of content in the same area. A tab view includes a tabbed control (which is similar in appearance to a segmented control and a content area. Each segment of a tabbed control is known as a tab, and clicking a tab displays its corresponding pane in the content area. Although the amount of content can vary from pane to pane, switching tabs doesn’t change the overall size of the tab view or its parent window.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use when there is limited visual space and content needs to be separated into sections.</li>
          <li>Use when there are between 2 – 9 sections of content that need a flat navigation mode.</li>
          <li>Use when you need to keep user attention by circumventing page refreshing.</li>
          <li>Use when section names are relatively short.</li>
          <li>Use when the content of each tab can be viewed separate from each other, and not in context of each other.</li>
          <li>Use when the content for each tab has similar structure.</li>
          <li>Use when you need to show what tab is currently being viewed.</li>
          <li>Do not use when the content inside each pane would function just as well in its own separate page.</li>
