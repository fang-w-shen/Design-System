            <div class="large-12 cell content-container">
              <p>What's the value of a design system? We're glad you asked!</p>
              <p>Let’s take a detailed look at the many ways a design system can be a much-needed painkiller for your growing
                pains.</p>
              <h3>Scale Design</h3>
              <p>As teams grow, it’s common for designers to concentrate on discrete areas of an app like search and discovery,
                account management, and more. This can lead to a fragmented visual language—like a Tower of Babel of design—with
                each designer speaking her own language. This happens when designers solve problems individually and not
                systematically.</p>
              <p>With no common design language to unite the product, the user experience starts to break down, as does the design
                process. Design critiques become unproductive when there’s a dearth of design conventions. To create alignment
                within teams, there must be a shared source of truth—a place to reference official patterns and styles.</p>
              <p>Most often this is a static artifact, such as a design mock, but a static reference will almost immediately become
                outdated. That’s why teams build monuments like Shopify’s Polaris site—a design system site, built with the system,
                that documents all aspects of the system including the components, guidelines, and UX best practices. And because
                it is built with the system, it will always be up-to-date.</p>
              <p>An internal design systems site is the best, most accessible source of truth for product teams. It provides the
                gravitational pull to keep team members aligned and in sync.</p>
              <h3>Manage Debt</h3>
              <p>As applications and their teams age, they build debt. Not financial debt, but technical and design debt. Debt is acquired by building for the short-term. Design debt is made up of an overabundance of non-reusable and inconsistent styles and conventions, and the interest is the impossible task of maintaining them. Over time, the accumulation of this debt becomes a great weight that slows growth.</p>
              <p>The act of creation does not inherently create debt—just like spending money doesn’t inherently create financial debt. But using a design system will keep you on budget by keeping your design and code overhead low, while still allowing you to grow and evolve your application.</p>
              <h3>Design Consistently</h3>
              <p>Standardized components used consistently and repetitively create a more predictable and easy to understand application. Standardized components also allow designers to spend less time focused on style and more time developing a better user experience.</p>
              <h3>Prototype Faster</h3>
              <p>Working within an existing design system allows you to piece together flows and interactions as quickly as pulling LEGO blocks from a bin. This allows you to build an endless amount of prototypes and variants for experimentation, helping your team gain insights and data fast.</p>
              <h3>Iterate Quicker</h3>
              <p>Whether evolving the style of your UI or making UX changes to a flow, using a design system reduces effort from hundreds of lines of code to as little as a few characters. This makes iterations quick and painless, and experimentation much faster.</p>
              <h3>Improve Usability</h3>
              <p>Inconsistent interface conventions hinder usability. When CSS for countless unique interface elements and their interactions increase, so does cognitive load and page weight. This makes for a terrible user experience. It can also create conflicting CSS and JavaScript, potentially breaking your app. By using a design system, you’re able to avoid these conflicts by building a holistic library of components, instead of per page, which means you’ll spend less time in quality assurance.</p>
              <h3>Accessibility</h3>
              <p>Accessibility can be implemented at the component level by optimizing for those with disabilities, on slow Internet speeds, or on old computers. This is an easy usability win. In Chapter 3, Building your design system, Katie Sylor-Miller explains how design systems can help improve your product’s accessibility and compliance with your country’s laws.</p>
